//! Backpressure for early Mail notices. Mail is meant not to interrupt work.
//! A notice the unread tick sent early, because the Actor looked idle, carries
//! `deliver_by`: the time the busy delay would have sent it anyway. Until then a
//! batch made only of such notices is admitted to a managed Actor only while it
//! is idle; otherwise it is withheld: the delivery is withdrawn without sending
//! anything, and the unread tick issues a fresh notice once the Actor is idle,
//! provided the Mail is still unread, so Mail read in the meantime is never
//! announced. A held notice does not wait in the delivery queue; if recording
//! the withdrawal fails, only the record is retried. As for any delivery, a
//! daemon that dies between claiming a notice and recording its outcome leaves
//! it ambiguous, and that notice is not re-issued.
//!
//! Idle is what the Runtime reports: no turn running and not waiting for
//! approval. An early notice is held while the Runtime reports work when it is
//! admitted. Admission and the terminal write are not atomic, and a delivery
//! written moments before the Runtime starts on it can share its turn with a
//! notice; that window is accepted for simplicity.
